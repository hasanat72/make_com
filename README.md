Built a Simple Automation Tool with Google Workspace
I created a lightweight system using Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Gmail to streamline order processing for a small business setup.

The flow:
Customer submits an order via Google Form
Data is instantly recorded in a Google Sheet
A confirmation email is triggered automatically through Gmail
Everything is tied together using Make.com for seamless automation â€” no manual copy-pasting, no delays.
